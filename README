Clean Kernel EC05 for the Samsung Epic 4G

The purpose of this kernel is to provide root and busybox, with minimal system changes. Designed to flash back stock kernel, to allow OTA updates.

How to compile: 
If you do not have the toolchain then get it from codesourcery.com and install/extract.  Since I am compiling on an Ubuntu VM I use:

http://www.codesourcery.com/public/gnu_toolchain/arm-none-linux-gnueabi/arm-2009q3-67-arm-none-linux-gnueabi-i686-pc-linux-gnu.tar.bz2

Browse to Kernel/arch/arm/configs/ and edit Clean.Kernel_defconfig and change the path for CONFIG_INITRAMFS_SOURCE=
to the absolute path of the initramfs.

Then refer to the README.txt on what else you need to change.
